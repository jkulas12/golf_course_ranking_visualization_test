Documentation
=============
'.limitslider(options)'
-----------------------
Create one or more limitsliders or access an existing limitslider.

Limitslider is based on the standard jQueryUI Slider widget and inherits it's
API interface.

This means all options, methods and events describer for it are
supported in addition to all the options, methods and events described below.

API documentation for jQueryUI Slider can be found here:
http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/

Options
-------
### **classEven** (string, default: `ui-slider-handle-even`)
Name of a class that is set for every even (second, fourth, etc.) slider handle.

### **classOdd** (string, default: `ui-slider-handle-odd`)
Name of a class that is set for every odd (first, third, etc.) slider handle.

### **gap** (positive float, default: `undefined`)
Sets the minimal distance between individual sliders. If set to `undefined`,
sliders may cross each other. Set to `0`, they may touch, but not cross.
Any greater value will force the sliders to be atleast the specified amount
apart.

Units are in parts of the slider range defined by `min` and `max`.

### **label** (boolean or function, default: `false`)
If enabled, each slider will have a label printed on it.

By default, the	label will simply contain the current position number.

Alternatively, you can set a function which will receive the current position
as it's first argument and the 0-based index of the handle as the second
argument. The function should return a string.

Please keep in mind that space on the slider buttons is limited.

### **limit** (default: `undefined`)
Sets the lower and upper limit (or gap) of all sliders.

### **limits** (default: `undefined`)
@TODO

### **max** (positive float, default: `100`)
The maximum value of the range.

### **min** (positive float, default: `0`)
The minimum value of the range.

### **ranges** (default: `undefined`)
Sets any marked ranges that are visible. If defined, must be an array with at
most the number of sliders + 1 (for each range to the left of each slider and
one additional at the right side). A `false` value means the corresponding
range is not marked. A `true` value does mark the range.

You may also use an object for each position, with a `class` property which will
be set for the corresponding range, in addition to the normal marking. i.e.
`{'styleClass': 'red-range'}`.

### **title** (boolean or function, default: `false`)
If enabled, each slider will have a title shown by hovering over it.

By default, the title will simply contain the current position number.

Alternatively, you can set a function which will receive the current position
as it's first argument and the 0-based index of the handle as the second
argument. The function should return a string.

### **values** (default: `[]`)
Array or values for the positions of the sliders. The number of items in the 
array determines the number of sliders. If not specified, the plugin will 
default to a single slider as per jQueryUI's slider.

	be automatically calculated averaged for the surrounding handles.
